Daos organizations of KongsenYoung

The main reason that I would like to create the temporary ten DAOs is I want to participate in the great revolution of the production system and production relationship. And I have contemplated really much on the main idea of how to build a personally-perceived great organization. These thoughts, spirit, and systematic overview is closely related to my past education, grown-up and media-literacy backgrounds.

Let me take some imaginary theories, concepts, and practices behind the DAO as examples.

The Edutopidea DAO is my nice image of an idealized society and effective organization existence.

The OpenUni DAO is the imaginably great and fully supportive universal universities forms and existence better than anyone of the current universities nowadays.

The MeLinker DAO is based on six-degree segment theory and networking science in the field of complexity science and practice.

The thoughts behind CoDesign DAO are inspired by Figma, Photoshop, and the Jishi Design app’s development changes, challenges, and self-evolution processes.

The AIWrite DAO considerately pays enough attention to the quick changes and impressive challenges brought by OpenAI and its LLM series AI models as well as the related developments in the field of artificial intelligence. This DAO encourages its partners and participants to use AI tools to empower their writing, revise their drafts and constantly optimize their achievements effectively.

The OpenLife DAO is more like a combination of experimental trials and my personal life work study practice. Because I always keep the habit of reading, writing, meditation, and exchanging ideas with my friends, mentors, and some astonishing book authors. Then someday after a movie watching an idea emerges in my brain: can I just make all my life records, what I read, write, thinking processes, and communication experience just open sourced to others? 

If I can do this, someday when more people like me attend this activity, then we just achieve a seemingly impossible goal: 

Open source all the life of all human beings. 

It excites me a lot and is long. So these are the background thoughts, trials, and practices of how and why I will build a DAO named OpenLife.

When I see the sentence by Albert Einstein, I make up an idea that someday I should build at least one organization that is imaginative driven, and oriented. Alright, this sentence is in the following:

iMagination is further more important than knowledge.

Except for the Imagineer DAO I’ve created, I have books writing plan which contains one named: 《iMagination Assets》. 

Because I think that imagination is truly more essential than knowledge so I will practice some imagination productions such as related books and seminars, and the programs and communities I will definitely build.

Please expect my future updates of Daos and books at:
